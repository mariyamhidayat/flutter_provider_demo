stateless:

stateless code its tree form
its immutable jo ak dafa state pe build jo gaay dubara change nhi kr skte
variable cannot change value in stateless which means jo cheez ak dafa build ho jaay aap os ko change nhi kr skte

stateful:

state full widget its user interactive and mutable
use setstate() for update
rebuild all widgets its disadvantage because its time consuming if you want only change one widget buts its rebuild all widgets so pressure the RAM snd some time its hang
so isliye hum state management use krte hn.

why use provider:

Provider is used in Flutter for state management. It helps you:
Share data across widgets easily
Listen to changes and update UI automatically

Keep code clean and maintainable
